# Learn C the Hard Way

This repository contains the code from Zed Shaw's online book [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

Most of the code here contains the base code from the book, but some of it I have added functionality to, helpful documentation, or completed some of the __Extra Credit__ parts at the end of each exercise.

To retrieve the code locally, and compile all of the code to be run, issue the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/caseyscarborough/learn-c-the-hard-way.git
$ cd learn-c-the-hard-way
$ make
```

You can then run the individual exercises by executing each them in the bin directory.

```bash
$ bin/ex1
Hello, world!
$ bin/ex14
'b' == 98 'i' == 105 'n' == 110 'e' == 101 'x' == 120
...
```
