# Learn C the Hard Way

This repository contains the code from Zed Shaw's online book [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

Most of the code here contains the base code from the book, but some of it I have added functionality to, helpful documentation, or completed some of the __Extra Credit__ parts at the end of each exercise.
